## unsigned char ch395_check_exist();

***Description***

Checks if ch395 exists



## void ch395_clear_recv_buf_sn(unsigned char ID_SOCKET)

***Description***

This command is used to clear the Socket receive buffer. It is necessary to input 1 byte of Socket index value. Upon receiving this command, CH395 will reset the receiving length of this Socket, and the receiving pointer will point to the buffer head.



## void ch395_close_socket_sn(unsigned char socketid)

***Description***

This command is used to close Socket. It is necessary to input a 1 byte of Socket index value. After Socket is closed, the receive buffer and transmit buffer of Socket are emptied, but the configuration information is still reserved, and you just need to open the Socket again when using the Socket the next time. In TCP mode, CH395 will automatically disconnect TCP before turning off Socket.

***Input***




## void ch395_dhcp_enable()

***Description***

This command is used to start or stop DHCP. It is necessary to input a 1-byte flag. If the flag is 1, it will indicate that DHCP is on; if the flag is 0, it will indicate that DHCP is off. CH395 must be initialized before DHCP is started. After DHCP is started, CH395 will broadcast DHCPDISCOVER message to the network to discover DHCP Server, request the address and other configuration parameters after finding DHCP Server, and then generate GINT_STAT_DHCP interrupt. MCU can send GET_DHCP_STATUS command to get DHCP status. If the status code is 0, it will indicate success, and MCU can send the command GET_IP_INF to get IP, MASK and other information. If the status code is 1, it will indicate error, which is generally caused by timeout, for example, no DHCP Server is found. DHCP is always in a working state after startup unless it receives a DHCP shutdown command from MCU. During this process, if DHCP Server reassigns a configuration to CH395 and the configuration is different from the original configuration, CH395 will still generate an interrupt. After timeout interrupt is generated, if DHCP Server is not found, CH395 will continue to send DHCPDISCOVER message at an interval of about 16 seconds. It takes about 20MS to execute this command. MCU can send GET_CMD_STATUS to query whether the execution has finished and the execution status
