## ch395_check_exist

***Description***

This command is used to test the communication interface and working state to check whether CH395 is working properly. This command needs to input 1 byte of data, which can be any data. If CH395 is working properly, the output data of CH395 will be the bitwise reverse of the input data. For example, if the input data is 57H, the output data will be A8H.


***Modify***

***Returns***

* Accumulator : Returns '#CH395_DETECTED' if it exists


***Example***

```ca65
 jsr ch395_check_exist

 rts
ch395_connected:
```

## ch395_clear_recv_buf_sn

***Description***

This command is used to clear the Socket receive buffer. It is necessary to input 1 byte of Socket index value. Upon receiving this command, CH395 will reset the receiving length of this Socket, and the receiving pointer will point to the buffer head.

***Input***

* Accumulator : Socket id

***Modify***

* Accumulator 
* Y Register 

***Example***

```ca65
 lda #CH395_SOCKET1 ; Socket ID
 jsr ch395_clear_recv_buf_sn
```



---

## ch395_close_socket_sn

***Description***

This command is used to close Socket. It is necessary to input a 1 byte of Socket index value. After Socket is closed, the receive buffer and transmit buffer of Socket are emptied, but the configuration information is still reserved, and you just need to open the Socket again when using the Socket the next time. In TCP mode, CH395 will automatically disconnect TCP before turning off Socket.

***Input***

* Accumulator : The id of the socket to close

***Modify***

* Y Register 

***Example***

```ca65
 lda #$01 ; Socket ID
 jsr ch395_close_socket_sn
```

## ch395_dhcp_enable

***Description***

This command is used to start or stop DHCP. It is necessary to input a 1-byte flag. If the flag is 1, it will indicate that DHCP is on; if the flag is 0, it will indicate that DHCP is off. CH395 must be initialized before DHCP is started. After DHCP is started, CH395 will broadcast DHCPDISCOVER message to the network to discover DHCP Server, request the address and other configuration parameters after finding DHCP Server, and then generate GINT_STAT_DHCP interrupt. MCU can send GET_DHCP_STATUS command to get DHCP status. If the status code is 0, it will indicate success, and MCU can send the command GET_IP_INF to get IP, MASK and other information. If the status code is 1, it will indicate error, which is generally caused by timeout, for example, no DHCP Server is found. DHCP is always in a working state after startup unless it receives a DHCP shutdown command from MCU. During this process, if DHCP Server reassigns a configuration to CH395 and the configuration is different from the original configuration, CH395 will still generate an interrupt. After timeout interrupt is generated, if DHCP Server is not found, CH395 will continue to send DHCPDISCOVER message at an interval of about 16 seconds. It takes about 20MS to execute this command. MCU can send GET_CMD_STATUS to query whether the execution has finished and the execution status

***Input***

* Accumulator : The mode to activate DHCP mode

***Modify***

* X Register

## ch395_enter_sleep

***Description***

This command enables CH395 chip in a low-power sleep suspended state. When MCU writes a new command to CH395 (no data input command, such as CMD_GET_IC_VER), it will exit the low-power state. For the parallel port and SPI interface communication modes, active SCS chip selection will also cause CH395 to exit the low-power state, so MCU shall immediately disable the SCS chip selection after sending the command CMD_ENTER_SLEEP. In sleep state, MAC and PHY of CH395 will be in power off mode and disconnect Ethernet. Typically, it takes several milliseconds for CH395 to exit the low-power state.

## ch395_get_glob_int_status

***Description***

This command is used to get the global interrupt status. CH395 will output 1 byte of global interrupt status after receiving this command. Global interrupt status is defined as follows:

Bit Name Description

7 GINT_STAT_SOCK3 Socket3 interrupt

6 GINT_STAT_SOCK2 Socket2 interrupt

5 GINT_STAT_SOCK1 Socket1 interrupt

4 GINT_STAT_SOCK0 Socket0 interrupt

3 GINT_STAT_DHCP DHCP interrupt

2 GINT_STAT_PHY_CHANGE PHY status change interrupt

1 GINT_STAT_IP_CONFLI IP conflict

0 GINT_STAT_UNREACH Inaccessible interrupt

① GINT_STAT_UNREACH: Inaccessible interrupt. When CH395 receives ICMP inaccessible interrupt

message, it saves the IP address, port and protocol type of the inaccessible IP packet in the inaccessible

information table, and then generates an interrupt. When the MCU receives the interrupt, it can send the

command GET_UNREACH_IPPORT to get the inaccessible information.

② GINT_STAT_IP_CONFLI: IP conflict interrupt. This interrupt is generated when CH395 detects that its

IP address is the same as that of other network devices in the same network segment.

③ GINT_STAT_PHY_CHANGE: PHY change interrupt. This interrupt is generated when PHY connection

of CH395 changes, for example, PHY state changes from the connected state to the disconnected state or

from the disconnected state to the connected state. MCU can send GET_PHY_STATUS command to get

the current PHY connection status.

④ GINT_STAT_DHCP: DHCP interrupt. If MCU enables DHCP function of CH395, CH395 will generate

this interrupt. MCU can send the command CMD_GET_DHCP_STATUS to get the DHCP status. If the

status is 0, it will indicate success; otherwise, it will indicate timeout failure.

⑤ GINT_STAT_SOCK0 - GINT_STAT_SOCK3: Socket interrupt. When there is an interrupt event in

Socket, CH395 will generate this interrupt. MCU needs to send GET_INT_STATUS_SN to get the

interrupt status of Socket. Please refer to GET_INT_STATUS_SN.

When this command is completed, CH395 will set INT# pin to high level and clear the global interrupt

status

## ch395_read_recv_buf_sn

***Description***

This command is used to read data from Socket receive buffer. It is necessary to input 1 byte of Socket index value and 2 bytes of length (low bytes in front).

The length of the read data can be less than the actual effective length of the buffer, the unread data is still reserved in the receive buffer, and MCU can continue to read through this command. In MACRAW mode, the processing modes are different. In MACRAW mode, the receive buffer is a frame buffer, which can cache only 1 frame of Ethernet data. After CH395 processes the command READ_RECV_BUF_SN, Socket0 receive buffer will be cleared, so MCU shall read all valid data of the buffer at a time.

When these pins are suspended, the baud rate is 9600bps by default. If MCU supports high communication speed, the serial communication baud rate can be dynamically regulated through this command. This command requires the input of three data, namely, baudrate coefficient 0, baud rate coefficient 1 and baud rate coefficient 2. The following table shows the corresponding relationship with baud rates.
