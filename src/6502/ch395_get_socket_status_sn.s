    ;;@brief This command is used to get Socket status. It is necessary to input a 1 byte of Socket index value. CH395 will output a 2-byte status code when receiving this command. The first status code is the status code of Socket. The status code of Socket is defined as follows:
    ;;Code Name
    ;;00H SOCKET_CLOSED
    ;;05H SOCKET_OPEN
    ;;The second status code is TCP status code, which is only meaningful when TCP mode has been on. TCP
    ;;status code is defined as follows:
    ;;Code Name Description
    ;;00H TCP_CLOSED Closed
    ;;01H TCP_LISTEN Monitoring
    ;;02H TCP_SYN_SENT SYN sent
    ;;03H TCP_SYN_RCVD SYN received
    ;;04H TCP_ESTABLISHED TCP connection established
    ;;05H TCP_FIN_WAIT_1 The active closing side first sends FIN
    ;;06H TCP_FIN_WAIT_2 The active closing side receives an ACK from FIN
    ;;07H TCP_CLOSE_WAIT The passive closing side receives FIN
    ;;08H TCP_CLOSING Closing
    ;;09H TCP_LAST_ACK The passive closing side sends FIN
    ;;0AH TCP_TIME_WAIT 2MLS waiting status
    ;;TCP status is defined in TCP/IP protocol. Please refer to TCP/IP protocol for the detailed meaning
